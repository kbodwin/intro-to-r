## What your typical week will look like

### Coursework

Each week, you will be expected to work through a sequence of readings, videos, and check-ins. 
(Much like this one!)
These are meant to replace the in-class lecture experience; thus, you should plan 
to devote about 1-3 hours a week to this Coursework. 


### Practice Activities

*Suggested Due Date: Thursdays at midnight*

As part of your "in-class" style work, you will also have short practice tasks to complete, to tie together the material.  You should plan for these to take you 1-3 hours per week.

These are meant to replace the in-class group work experience; as such, you are strongly encouraged to work on these in groups.


### Lab Assignments

*Suggested Due Date: Sundays at midnight*

Lab work is **individual**.  Although you may discuss ideas with your classmates 
and seek help from the usual sources, all code and text should be your own.  

**Full Course** subscribers may have their labs graded, if they wish, as long as the
submission is on-time.



### Challenge

Each week, your Lab Assignment will have an optional challenge, which will require
you to learn and use skills beyond what is covered in the assignment. 

Give these a try, if you want to push your R skills to the next level!

# Tips for succeeding in this class:

---

## Take the Coursework pages as seriously as you would take in-person lecture.


With this class being online and unofficial, there will likely be a temptation 
to skip things, multitask, and cut corners.  

I want to encourage you to commit to giving the Coursework segments the same 
level of attention that you would ordinarily give to in-class lecture.  
Put the same effort into the Check-In Activities that you would if you were 
sitting in a classroom.

In return for your efforts, I promise to design the coursework
carefully, so that I do not waste your time.

## Google is your friend.

The R community has an enormous aresenal of online learning resources.

Learn to Google for tutorials and examples; to use [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/); to ask questions on Twitter; and to otherwise make good use of the vast and welcoming R network on the internet.

##  Find ways to work together.

While much of this course is identical to the in-person version, it is impossible 
to fully replicate the experience of working together on a coding task in person.

We encourage you to establish Study Buddies and/or Study Groups early in the quarter, 
even if you don't know anyone yet.  

The class Discord server is a great way to get started, if you are a Patreon subscriber.  I also hope you will be proactive about setting up your own video chat sessions, phone calls, Google Docs, group chats, etc.  (How many different platforms can you talk about R on?  Facebook? Snapchat?  Instagram?  TikTok?  Bumble???)

I hope that we will all be purposeful and creative about finding ways to work as a team.
