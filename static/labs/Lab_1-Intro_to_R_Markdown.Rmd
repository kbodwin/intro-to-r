## Setup

### Make a Course Folder

If you have not already, create a folder on your computer to dedicate to this course.

### Create your Lab 1 File

1. Open RStudio.cloud or RStudio on your computer (preferably RStudio on your computer!)

2. In RStudio, go to "File" > "New File…" > "R Markdown…" and click "OK" in the dialog without changing anything.

3. Delete all the placeholder text in that new file and replace it with this:

    ````text
    ---
    title: "Lab 1"
    author: "Put your name here"
    output: html_document
    ---
    
    
    # Setup
    
    `r ''````{r load-libraries-data, include = FALSE}
    library(tidyverse)
    
    cars <- ggplot2::mpg
    ```
    
    ## About the dataset
    
    This dataset contains information about ______.
    
    It has _____ rows and ______ variables.
    
    # Plot 1
    
    Replace this line with a code chunk and use it to create a plot.
    
    # Plot 2
    
    # Plot 3
    
    ````

4. Save the R Markdown file with some sort of name (**without any spaces!**). Make sure you save it somewhere in your new course folder.


## Lab Instructions


### Run the provided code

Click the "Play" button on the right of the first code chunk to run the code.
Alternatively, you can highlight the code you want to run and type <kbd>ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>⌘<</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  You should see the lines
of code appear in the *console*, and a data frame named `cars` should appear in
your *environment*.

### Check the data documentation

In your **console** (*NOT* in the R Markdown document), type `?ggplot2::mpg`.

Use the information that pops up in your *Help* pane in RStudio to fill in the
blanks in the Dataset Information section.


### Make a code chunk

Remove the text that says "Replace this line with a code chunk" and insert a new R code chunk. Either type <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> on Windows, or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⌥</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> on macOS, or use the "Insert Chunk" menu:

![](../../Images/other/insert-chunk-button.png)

### Create and discuss some visualizations

Use `ggplot()` to create three plots using the `mpg` dataset.

* Plot 1: Summarize one **categorical** variable, with a bar plot.

* Plot 2: Compare two **quantitative** (numeric) variables, with a scatter plot.

* Plot 3:  Compare a **quantitative** variable **across categories** with a side-by-side box plot.

Type the code to create each new plot in a new empty chunk, in the appropriate
section of your document.

For full credit, make sure your plots have reasonable axis labels.  For example,
if you use the `fl` variable, your axis should say "Fuel Type" not "fl".

In regular text (possibly using *Markdown* formatting!), type a very brief interpretation
of the plot.  What does it show?  What do you learn about cars from this plot?


### Knit your document

Knit your document as an **html** file. Use the "Knit" menu:

![](../../Images/other/knit-button.png)

If you run into trouble knitting, try running your code again in order, and see
if you can find the problem.

Another common issue is deleting the tick marks (`/``` `) that surrpund your code
chunks.  If you notice that the code chunks are not showing a "play" button,
or that they are not highlighted in grey, double check your tick marks!


:::fyi
You'll be doing this same process for all your future Lab Assignments and
Practice Activities. Each of these will involve an R Markdown file. 

We will discuss easy ways to manage all these documents starting next week.

## Challenge: 

### Pretty R Markdown documents

There are infinitely many ways to make R Markdown documents look prettier or fancier.  In fact, that's how I create all the coursework and assignment documents for this class!

Read through [this guide](https://holtzy.github.io/Pimp-my-rmd/), and make sure to check out the [themes](https://holtzy.github.io/Pimp-my-rmd/#theme) and [templates](https://holtzy.github.io/Pimp-my-rmd/#template) sections.

Apply a new theme or template, and any other tricks you want,
to your Lab 1 document.
