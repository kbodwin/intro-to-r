Welcome! Let's start out with a few more details about this course.

## Navigating the work

### Lessons

Each week you will have a few lessons (<i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i>) to work through.  These will consist
of videos from me, videos and readings from online, and a few small check-in activities.

I encourage you to treat these lessons like in-person lecture.  Set aside time to work through the whole lesson at once, and work through each step in order - don't skip around!

Time estimates are provided, but these will vary from person-to-person.  On the whole, the total Lesson time each week should be around 4 hours, much like for an in-person college course.

### Practice Puzzles

The practice puzzles (<i class="fas fa-puzzle-piece"></i>) will ask you to do a series of specific steps that will require you to use your new skills from the week's material.  If you succeed, you will be rewarded with a single clear answer; for example, in puzzle 1, you will decode a message to reveal a secret poem!

These are very much meant to be for your practice. Don't hesitate to ask questions, share answers, and Google information.

### Labs

To bring together your weekly skills, you are asked to perform a real data analysis. (<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>).  Try to give this task your absolute best; this is your chance to use your new
skills the way you might in a job or a research project.

At the end of each lab is a "Challenge" that will push you a little outside your comfort zone.  I encourage you to try these out!

Have you ever told yourself you would work through an online course, but found it difficult to keep yourself accountable without a classroom structure?

Have you ever started teaching yourself something with online tools, only to get frustrated when you are stuck on a small confusion with nobody to ask for help?
